Thanks to Jens Timmerman <jens.timmerman@gmail.com> for some of the
code to select multiple pieces

This plugin adds a tab that will show the status of each piece of the
torrent.

There are three states for each piece: 
not downloaded, downloaded, or currently downloading.  
These are indicated by color.

You can easily set the priority of a piece or a set of pieces by selecting them,
right-click and set the priority.

You can select multiple pieces in a few ways.
 - Click the first piece you want to select.  Hold Shift and click the
   last piece you want to select.  All pieces in between will be
	 selected.
 - Clicking and dragging over the pieces you want to select
 - Holding Ctrl will start selecting pieces without unselecting the
   ones you have already selected


Underneath all the pieces is a checkbox that will allow you to always
prioritize the first un-downloaded piece of the torrent. This lets you
start watching a movie while it is still downloading. After completing
the torrent you should continue to seed for a while, because this
behaviour is actually not sociable and bad for the torrent
protocol. Please use with care. 


To install this plugin in deluge: go to edit, preferences, plugins,
install plugin and select the .egg file.
