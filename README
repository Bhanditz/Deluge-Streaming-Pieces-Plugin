Pieces Plugin

Thanks to Jens Timmerman <jens.timmerman@gmail.com> for code to select
multiple pieces

This plugin adds a tab that will show the status of each piece of the torrent.

There are three states for each piece: 
not downloaded, downloaded, or currently downloading.  
These are indicated by color.

You can easily set the priority of a piece or a set of pieces by selecting them,
right-click and set the priority.

<todo> Add an option to always prioritize the first needed pieces, so you can start
watching a movie whils't it is still downloading.

After completing the torrent you should continue to seed for a while, because this 
behaviour is actually not sociable and bad for the torrent protocol. Please use with care </todo>

To install this plugin in deluge: go to edit, preferences, plugins, install plugin and select the .egg file.
