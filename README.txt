Pieces Plugin

Adds a tab that will show the status 
of each piece of the torrent. (pieces plugin by nick@afternight.org)

There are three states for each piece: 
not downloaded, downloaded, or currently downloading.  
These are indicated by color.

You can easily set the priority of a piece or a set of pieces by selecting them,
right-click and set the priority.

<todo> add an option to always prioritize the first needed pieces, so you can start
watching a movie whils't it is still downloading f.ex.

After completing the torrent you should continue to seed for a while, because this 
behaviour is actually not sociable and bad for the torrent protocol. Please use with care </todo>

Completely based on the pieces plugin by Nick Lanham <nick@afternight.org>

Only the multiple select blocks to prioritize <todo> and option to prioritize the first needed pieces</todo>
were added in this plugin.

To install this plugin in deluge: go to edit, preferences, plugins, install plugin and select the .egg file.
